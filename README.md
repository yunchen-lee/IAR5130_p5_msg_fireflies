# Synchronous Fireflies 
Each dot represents a firefly. They each have their own glowing clock and adjust it according to the signals from nearby fireflies. This results in the phenomenon of all fireflies synchronizing.
每個點都代表一隻螢火蟲。每隻螢火蟲都有自己發光的生理時鐘，並根據身邊同伴的訊號微調自己的時鐘，最終所有螢火蟲會逐漸趨於同步。

### How to play
In this firefly synchronization simulation: 
1. The signal will be sent through the edge
2. Clicking on the firefly will change its color, and simultaneously change the color of the fireflies synchronized with it. This allows us to easily check which fireflies are already synchronized.
3. `reset clock` will scramble all firefly clocks.
4. `reset color` will reset all firefly colors to the same.
5. `new edge` can add an edge between two points, please input the numbers of two fireflies, separated by a comma, for example `0,8`.
